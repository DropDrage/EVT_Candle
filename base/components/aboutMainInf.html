        The entire Brendle collection is <b>vegan, cruelty-free, and phthalate-free</b> â€” always.
        All of our candles are made with 100% domestically-grown soy wax. While our production methods have
        improved over the years,
        something that hasn't changed about Brendle products is the people behind them. All of our products are
        developed,
        produced, tested, packed, and shipped by our team out of our warehouse in London, UK.
